Titanic Survival Prediction
Task Objectives
This project aims to predict Titanic passenger survival using Machine Learning. The dataset includes various features like passenger class, age, gender, fare, and embarkation point. The model is built using Random Forest Classifier and optimized with GridSearchCV.
Key Goals:
âœ… Preprocess and clean the dataset
âœ… Engineer new features for better predictions
âœ… Train and evaluate a classification model
âœ… Optimize hyperparameters using Grid Search
âœ… Save the trained model for future use
